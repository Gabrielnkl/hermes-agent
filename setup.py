"""
setup.py — wheel/sdist build guard.

pip/PyPI and Homebrew are no longer supported distribution methods for
Hermes Agent (see website/docs/getting-started/platform-support.md). The
wheel would ship without bundled assets (locales, skills, optional-mcps,
web_dist, tui_dist, plugin manifests) since those are resolved at runtime
via env-var overrides set by the nix wrapper or the source-checkout layout.

This file overrides the ``bdist_wheel`` and ``sdist`` setuptools commands
to raise an error when run outside a Nix build. The PEP 517
``build_wheel`` / ``build_sdist`` hooks in
``setuptools.build_meta`` call these commands internally, so the guard
fires for ``uv build``, ``pip wheel``, ``python -m build``, and direct
``setup.py`` invocations alike.

The one legitimate consumer of ``build_wheel`` is uv2nix, which calls
``setuptools.build_meta.build_wheel`` (→ ``bdist_wheel``) inside a Nix
build sandbox. Nix sets ``NIX_BUILD_TOP`` in the build environment, so
we allow the build when that is present.

Editable installs (``uv sync``, ``pip install -e .``, ``nix develop``)
use ``build_editable``, which does NOT call ``bdist_wheel`` — it calls
``build_ext`` in editable mode. So the guard does not affect development.
